# jv-comp-challenge-1

This was my first static-comp challenge, where the goal was to recreate the website below - allowing creative license. The assignment proved to be very challenging and served as an introduction to flexbox and grid. Although I still have some problems with my site, I gave it my best shot and consider it better than what I could have done a week ago.

## Future Iterations

I would like to make this more creative and add more personal touches. My project still needs some work, the grid responsiveness is not functioning at the present moment.
