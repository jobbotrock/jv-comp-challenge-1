# jv-comp-challenge-1

This was my first static-comp challenge, where the goal was to recreate the website below - allowing creative license. The assignment proved to be very challenging and served as an introduction to flexbox and grid. Although I still have some problems with my site, I gave it my best shot and consider it better than what I could have done a week ago. My project needs some work by website responsiveness to the pictures.
